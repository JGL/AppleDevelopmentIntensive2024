  <div>Apple Development Intensive 2024, 🍎👩🏻‍💻: Swift Mornings.<br /><a href="index.html">Back to slide index</a>.</div>
  <div>
    👋🏻 Hi! I'm <a href="https://instagram.com/jgl">Joel</a>. My pronouns are he/him. I'm 43 and I live in London near Epping Forest with my fiancée and one cat.
  </div>
  <div>
    Welcome to the Creative Computing Institute!
  </div>
  <div>
    Welcome to the Apple Development Intensive 🍎👩🏻‍💻!
  </div>
  <div>This is a brand new course, so I'd love to hear all your feedback - please please please <a href="https://instagram.com/jgl">DM me on Instagram with your thoughts</a>, or <a href="https://joelgethinlewis.com/">email me, via my website</a>. I'm particularly looking out for good YouTube channels, so please share those if you find them.</div>
  <div>Next, let's go around the room and introduce ourselves, with how you like to be addressed, how you are feeling today and which course and college you are part of at UAL.</div>
  <div>
    Let's take a look at the
    <a href="https://jgl.github.io/AppleDevelopmentIntensive2024/">Apple Intensive Homepage</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JGL/AppleDevelopmentIntensive2024">the GitHub readme.md</a> and finally the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/AppleDevelopmentIntensive2024/wiki">GitHub wiki</a>.

      </ol>
    </div>

    <img src="images/skateBoardNotCar.PNG" />
    <div>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/henrikkniberg">Henrick Kniberg</a> on how to make a car. In other words, if you want to make a car, make a skateboard, then a scooter, then a bicycle, then a motorbike and THEN a car. I want you to make lots of skateboards.

    <div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Until_I_Say_Good-Bye:_My_Year_of_Living_with_Joy">Susan Wendell</a> wrote powerfully about disability and feminism. What explosion of knowledge could you make with your life?</div>

  <div>I want you all to be worms from now on. 🪱🍎. I want you to be like this! I want you to burrow into the Apple ecosystem and make new, beautiful, caring and playful apps that you want and you want to make for other groups that are important to you. Who might those be?</div>
  <div>Next, a really important diagram.</div>
  <div>
    <img src="images/JimCampbellFormula_for_computer_art.jpg" />
    <div><a href="https://jimcampbell.tv/">Jim Campbell</a>'s formula for Computer Art. Realise that you can use things without understanding every aspect of them. All that computers do is process inputs into outputs. That's it.</div>
  </div>
  <div>But what are we going to learn?</div>
  <div>
    <div>We are going to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift</a>, which is <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-top-paying-technologies">one of the most top paying programming languages in the world</a> as well as <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/app-store/developing-for-the-app-store/">audience of over 1.5 billion devices</a>. But it isn't about the money, it's about the impact. I want you to realise that your apps have just as much of a right to be on the home screen as anyone else's. Also, I have a feeling that the Apple Glasses are coming. You are all going to be in a superb position to make the first great apps for that device when it arrives.</div>
  </div>

  <div>Some situating yourself in the world resources:</div>
  <div>
    We are in a stressful time at the moment. Here are some resources for situating yourself in the world, and how to keep going, set up a studio (if you want) and what you (maybe) should be doing:

    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    Some brain exploding resources:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/">Wait but Why</a> - lots of great essays on interesting things - I started with this one - <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html">Your Life in Weeks</a>.</li>

    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    For inspiration for the things you can make on Apple platforms, let's take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/">Apple Design Awards 2023 winners and finalists</a>. Lots of behind the scenes articles on that page too.
  </div>
  <div>Before we start, I wanted to share a lovely analogy that an ex student ,Rocio suggested for what we are doing "we are setting up tools to get coding or get started with resources to find code, just like gathering materials you might need for other crafts like painting". I hope that's helpful!</div>
  <div>Signing up to GitHub - the best place to find and share code</div>
  <div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a> is a website that enables you to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> to store, edit and share all your code with other developers around the world. Git is software for tracking changes to and sharing those changes with other programmers. Git is open source, while GitHub is owned by Microsoft. Both are free to use. Github is the industry standard website for programmers - employers may look at your GitHub to see what kind of code you write and how you help others. It's the first place I go to find code to use in my own work.</div>
  <div>But what does that really mean? What problem does Git (and GitHub) solve? Over to <a href="https://youtu.be/BCQHnlnPusY?t=57">Daniel Shiffman</a> for a great explanation. (BTW, Dan's whole playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV">"Git and GitHub for Poets"</a> is the one I'd recommend to learn more about them both). There are lots of great resources for learning creative code online and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thecodingtrain">Dan's YouTube channel "The Coding Train" is the one that I recommend above all others</a>.</div>
  <div>Sign up to GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/signup">https://github.com/signup</a> - please use a non university email address to do this, so you can keep logging in after you've graduated. Pick a username that you wouldn't be embarrassed to apply for a job with! I'll give you 5 minutes to do this.</div>
  <div>We'll use those GitHub ID's later, but now let's move onto to some Swift...</div>
  <div>In the mornings, we are going to be using Apple's Swift Fundamentals textbook, which is part of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/higher-education/app-development/">Develop in Swift curriculum</a>. You can find links to all the text books (student and teacher versions are both free on Apple Books!) at the bottom of the page. You won't need them for this intensive, but they are useful for learning later, or as reference.</div>
  <div>You will need to download the following files:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://education-static.apple.com/fundamentals/xcode13/student.zip">Student files for Swift Fundamentals</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://education-static.apple.com/fundamentals/xcode13/teacher.zip">Teacher files for Swift Fundamentals (including all solutions)</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Next, make sure you have an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/108647">Apple ID</a> set up. You can become a member of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">Apple Developer Program</a> if you want, but it's not necessary to complete the Intensive - it's £99 a year.</div>
  <div>Finally, before going any further, please make sure you have <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/swift/playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds for Mac</a> installed on your computers.</div>
  <div>As I said at the start, this is the first time this intensive has run, so we are going to see how long it takes us to work through the content...</div>
  <div>Let's start with "1-01 Introduction to Swift and Playgrounds.key" and then "Lab - Introduction.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "1-02 Constants Variables and Data Types.key" and "Constants and Variables.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "1-03 Operators.key" and "Lab - Operators.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "1-04 Control Flow.key" and "Lab - Control Flow.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "2-01 Strings.key" and "Lab - Strings.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "2-02 Functions.key" and "Lab - Functions.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "2-03 Structures.key" and "Lab - Structures.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "2-04 Classes.key" and "Lab - Classes.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "2-05 Collections.key" and "Lab - Collections.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "2-06 Loops.key" and "Lab - Loops.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "3-01 Optionals.key" and "Lab - Optionals.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "3-02 Type Casting and Inspection.key" and "Lab - Type Casting.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "3-03 Guard.key" and "Lab - Guard.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "3-04 Scope.key" and "Lab - Scope.playground".</div>
  <div>Next: "3-05 Enumerations.key" and "Lab - Enumerations.playground".</div>
