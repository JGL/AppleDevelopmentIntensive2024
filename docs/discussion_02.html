  <div>This discussion session is all about the following article: <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">"Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names"</a>. I'll give you 5 minutes to read it, then we can have a discussion about it.</div>
  <div>What did you think of the article? Let's discuss it for 10 minutes.</div>
  <div>Here is an <a href="https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood">Awesome List of Falsehoods</a>. I'd like you to go through the list and pick one that you'd like to discuss with the group, I'll give you 5 minutes to pick one.</div>
  <div>Who has a falsehood they'd like to discuss? We have 10 minutes!</div>
  <div>BTW, What is an awesome list? "An awesome list is a list of awesome things curated by the community". <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">Naturally, there is an Awesome List of Awesome Lists</a>!</div>
